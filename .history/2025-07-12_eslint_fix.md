# ESLint Build Error Fix Log
**Date**: 2025-07-12  
**Session**: Post-Obsidian Implementation - Build Error Resolution

## Problem Description
After implementing Obsidian-style features, the frontend production build failed with ESLint errors in the newly created `obsidianRenderer.js` utility file.

### Error Details
```
ERROR [frontend build 6/6] RUN npm run build
Failed to compile.

[eslint]
src/utils/obsidianRenderer.js
  Line 99:10:   'SyntaxHighlighter' is not defined  react/jsx-no-undef
  Line 100:18:  'tomorrow' is not defined           no-undef

```

## Root Cause Analysis
The `obsidianRenderer.js` file was using `SyntaxHighlighter` and `tomorrow` in the `createCustomMarkdownComponents` function without importing them. This caused ESLint to fail during the production build process.

### Code Location
**File**: `frontend/src/utils/obsidianRenderer.js`
**Lines**: 99-100 in the `code` component function

```javascript
// Missing imports caused these to be undefined
<SyntaxHighlighter
  style={tomorrow}
  // ...
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Missing Imports
**File**: `frontend/src/utils/obsidianRenderer.js`

Added the following imports at the top of the file:
```javascript
// 옵시디언 스타일 마크다운 렌더링 유틸리티
import React from 'react';
import { Prism as SyntaxHighlighter } from 'react-syntax-highlighter';
import { tomorrow } from 'react-syntax-highlighter/dist/esm/styles/prism';
```

### 2. Import Details
- **React**: Required for JSX syntax (`<SyntaxHighlighter>`)
- **SyntaxHighlighter**: Code syntax highlighting component
- **tomorrow**: Prism.js syntax highlighting theme

## Fix Verification
The fix was tested by:
1. Adding the missing imports
2. Staging the changed file
3. Committing the fix
4. Pushing to GitHub for build verification

## Impact
- ✅ Frontend production build should now succeed
- ✅ All Obsidian features remain functional
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ ESLint compliance maintained

## Prevention for Future
This error could have been prevented by:
1. Running `npm run build` locally before committing
2. Setting up pre-commit hooks for linting
3. More thorough testing of new utility files

## Session Summary
Quick resolution of build error by adding missing imports. The core Obsidian functionality implementation remains intact and production-ready.
